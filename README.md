**Project Overview**

MedTimer is a senior-friendly daily medicine tracking web application built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to add medicines with scheduled times, view a color-coded daily checklist (Green = Taken, Yellow = Upcoming, Red = Missed), and automatically calculate a weekly adherence score. The app provides motivational tips and Turtle-drawn graphics to make the experience friendly, encouraging, and calming for elderly users. Its design focuses on accessibility, clarity, and real-world usability.

**Integration Details**

MedTimer integrates multiple Python modules and features to create a smooth and interactive experience:
  * Streamlit for the user interface (forms, checklists, layout, color-coded status).
  * Pandas for storing and updating the medicine list and adherence tracking.
  * Datetime to compare the current time with scheduled medicine times and mark doses as taken, upcoming, or missed.
  * Custom logic functions to calculate adherence, update dose statuses, and manage user input.
  * Turtle graphics to draw a smiley or trophy when adherence is high to motivate users.
All components work together in a simple, accessible layout designed for elderly usability.

**Deployment Instructions**

  1*Create a requirements.txt file containing the necessary libraries (e.g., streamlit, pandas).
  2*Create a GitHub repository and upload:
    *app.py
    *requirements.txt
    *README.md
Go to Streamlit Cloud → click Deploy an app.
Connect your GitHub account.
Select your repository and choose app.py as the main file.
Deploy the application.
Once deployed, copy the live link and include it in this README.
